> Standard Readme Style
Your README file is normally the first entry point to your code. It should tell people why they should use your module, how they can install it, and how they can use it. Standardizing how you write your README makes creating and maintaining your READMEs easier. Great documentation takes work!

This repository contains:

1. readme.md
2. [A badge](#badge) to point to this spec.

Standard Readme is designed for open source libraries.

## Overview

> Your documentation is complete when someone can use your module without ever
having to look at its code. This is very important. This makes it possible for
you to separate your module's documented interface from its internal
implementation (guts). This is good because it means that you are free to
change the module's internals as long as the interface remains the same.


The goals for this repository are:

1. Define the **Standard Readme** that will apply to all new repos in enterprise services.
2. A **compliant badge** for users. See [the badge](#badge).

## Install


```sh
$
```

### Pre req

```sh
$
```

### Local Install

```sh
$
```

### Deployment

```sh
$
```
## Usage

This is only a documentation package. You can print out [spec.md](spec.md) to your console:

```sh
$ standard-readme-spec
# Prints out the standard-readme spec
```

## Monitoring

Healthcheck:


## Badges

If your README is compliant with Standard-Readme and you're on GitHub, it would be great if you could add the badge. This allows people to link back to this Spec, and helps adoption of the README. The badge is **not required**.
